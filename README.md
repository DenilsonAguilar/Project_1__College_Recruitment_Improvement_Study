# College_Recruitment_Improvement_Study

## Overview

### The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys using Python. The primary objective is to provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes. The project is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a specific assignment.

####  Data Study Questions - Formulate the data study questions that will answer in my analysis.  I will also be assigned a few questions to answer by my instructor

#### Data Exploration and Cleaning - The datasets provided are messy.  I will explore the datasets, first in Excel. Then I will use Python to bring in my datasets into a my coding environment, and explore the datasets further to identify what cleaning actions I will perform on the data.

#### Data Analysis and Visualization - Using my cleaned dataset, I will then perform analysis to answer my data science questions.  my answers will be displayed using plotting techniques.  I will house my project and associated files on my Project 1 repository on GitHub.

#### Improve Your Plots - I will provide and receive feedback to/from my classmates via a Discussion Forum.
