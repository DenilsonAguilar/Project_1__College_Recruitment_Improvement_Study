# College_Recruitment_Improvement_Study

## Overview

### The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys using Python. The primary objective is to provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes. The project is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a specific assignment.

#### Data Analysis and Visualization - Using my cleaned dataset, I will then perform analysis to answer my data science questions.  my answers will be displayed using plotting techniques.  I will house my project and associated files on my Project 1 repository on GitHub. The 4 questions that will be answered using the cleaned files are listed below.

##### 1.  For each course in the latest survey,  what are the relative number of enrollments in the various degree programs? The degree field needs to be cleaned and condensed into a smaller number of categories. For example, all of the engineering majors should be collapsed into a single engineering category.

##### 2.Compare the race/ethnicity demographics of the survey over time (2020-2023).  What are the changes over time, if any?

##### 3. Which of the following extended factors (outside sources) impacted a student's decision to attend CCM the most?

##### 4. What is the most common way students hear about CCM? (Top 5)
